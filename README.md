- 👋 Hi, my names Nick Gallo and I am a currently enrolled Computer Science major a Johnson and Wales University.

- 👀 I found an interest in Computer Science back in my junior year of highschool. For my schools annual science fair, I learned the barebones of coding a video game through Unity.
From learning how to implement character designs to realistic physics, I was able to place first in my schools fair, and achieved second grant in the Rhode Island State Science
Fair.

- 🌱 I am currently looking to branch my knowledge as much as possible. My current project lies in Web Development. For the past few months, I have spent my time learning and
combining HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node, and MongoDB to create a forum page with full CRUD features and account validation.

- 💞️ I look to aim my future projects toward mobile app development. I have occasionally tinkered with Andriod Studio and  look forward to creating new projects in the mobile field

- 📫 For those looking to reach me, you can send me an email at mrnickgallo@gmail.com
